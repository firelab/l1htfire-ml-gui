A web app interface for the L1HTFire-ML model

The L1HTFire model (Linear 1-Dimensional Heat Transfer) is a physics-based wildland fire spread model created by the USFS Missoula Fire Sciences Laboratory. This is a Machine Learning (ML) Surrogate of L1HTFire and displays 3 output variables: fire spread rate, flame length, and flame zone depth. Google Research created the ML version using 575 million training runs of the physical model. The ML surrogate model is hosted here for demonstration purposes only in order to illustrate how wildland fire behavior results from the complex relationships between environmental and fire variables.
